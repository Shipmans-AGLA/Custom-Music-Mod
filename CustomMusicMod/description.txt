Customize the music in your game!
This mod contains a single file that changes the music to whatever music files you place in the music folder of this mod.
Does not come with any music, you have to put the music you want in yourself.
Works with calamity to not replace music while in a calamity biome, but also still works without calamity.
I put comments in the code to hopefully make reading and using the mod as clear as possible :)
Your music files need to be named correctly, so you should probably look at and refer to the code of this mod.
